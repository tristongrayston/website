In our Math 377 group project, under the supervision of Dr. Trefor Bazett, we challenged the conventional wisdom of "even-pacing" in cycling time trials. Recognizing that this strategy is suboptimal on courses with changing gradients, we developed a **Reinforcement Learning model** using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to find the ideal power distribution for a rider. Our model intelligently allocates a cyclist's energy throughout a race by considering the course profile alongside their unique physiological limitsâ€”Critical Power (CP) and Anaerobic Work Capacity (AWC). This project, **awarded a 98%**, successfully demonstrated that an RL-based approach can yield more effective and realistic pacing strategies than simpler methods. The work serves as a strong proof-of-concept for a real-world application that could give competitive cyclists a significant edge with personalized, data-driven race plans.
