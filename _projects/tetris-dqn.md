title: "Tetris + DQN"

My first personal project ever, started after my first year university and more-or-less completed after my second year. This project was my attempts to learn and utilize the fundamentals of reinforcement learning with neural networks. I began by implementing the atari game Tetris, helped primarily by Tech with Tim's tutorials. I then modified the base game to work with the OpenAI's gym interface, then wrote my own DQN RL-Agent with Numpy and Tensorflow. This project saw the DQN agent learn to consistently clear a couple of lines before enevitably dying. A first draft at an interesting project, but very insightful for a beginner.
