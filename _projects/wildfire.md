As the lead of a three-person team, I spearheaded a proof-of-concept research project to simulate AI-driven responses to wildfire spread, which we presented at the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CUCAI) 2024. Motivated by BC's devastating wildfire crisis, our simulation's realism was significantly enhanced by a team member with two terms of experience in the BC Wildfire Service, providing critical domain expertise. This dynamic environment modeled crucial factors like moisture and wind, creating a challenging testbed for our AI agents to combat the fire's adversarial and unpredictable spread. We deployed multiple agents, from a sophisticated Reinforcement Learning agent using PPO to a direct Heuristic agent, to learn effective containment strategies. The agents learned to proactively apply moisture to high-risk areas, leveraging techniques like elliptical wind kernels to anticipate the fire's movement. Culminating in a published paper, our research successfully demonstrates how simulations can validate AI strategies against complex, real-world disasters.
