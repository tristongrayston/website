This was an semi-formal lecture series done for the UVicAI club during my time as the president. More or less following basic structure as found in the Intro. to RL book by Sutton and Barto, and taught in a way prioritizing concepts rather than semantics. This was primarily meant for those who have never seen RL before but have had some experience with basic programming.

This series was taught over the course of 3 weeks, with two hour+ long lectures, and one being a workshop/live-code-along on tabular Q-learning.
