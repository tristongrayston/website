Our research, accepted for presentation at CUCAI 2025, investigates which deep learning architectures are most effective at creating internal "world models" for model-based reinforcement learning agents. While theoretically efficient, the success of model-based RL hinges on the network's ability to accurately learn an environment's complex dynamics. We systematically tested three architectures (Residual Networks, RNNs, and Neural Circuit Policies) across environments with diverse properties, from the chaotic Lorenz system to a partially observable pendulum. Our findings reveal that no single architecture excels universally; for instance, the RNN's structure proved superior where temporal context was crucial. This work provides a nuanced guide for matching specific architectures to environmental dynamics, paving the way for more robust and efficient RL agents. We had the honor of sharing these insights through a poster and a live presentation to an audience of over 200 students at the conference.
