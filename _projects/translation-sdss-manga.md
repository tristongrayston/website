This project was a proof-of-concept designed to address a key challenge in astrophysics: translating common, low-resolution SDSS spectral data into the more informative, but scarcer, MaNGA format (Developed by Hossen Teimoorinia, Finn Archinuk, Joanna Woo and Sara Shishehchi). My role was to implement and train a suite of generative models, including Autoencoders, VAEs, and VQ-VAEs to create a structured bridge between the two data types. This was my first immersion into a large-scale data environment, requiring me to build a pipeline to handle over 200,000 spectral samples. The experience was a formative lesson in managing large-scale data for model training. Ultimately, the work was a successful proof-of-concept, confirming that generative models are a viable solution for complex data translation tasks in scientific research.
