## About Me

I am a undergraduate student at the University of Victoria, in my last year studying Mathematics and Computer Science. During my time at the university I've developed on my passion for intelligent systems, fascinated by works which use computation to expand, develop or utilize some form of intelligence. On this website you'll see some of the projects I've made over my years as a developer.
